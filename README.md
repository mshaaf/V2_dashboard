# Personal Dashboard

A set of small, self-contained HTML apps that share a top bar.

## Setup & deploy

See [KEYS.md](KEYS.md) for where every key/link goes, and [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)
to run it locally (`vercel dev`) before deploying to Vercel.

## How to use

Open any `.html` file directly in your browser — no build step, no install.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [index.html](index.html) | Goals tracker (Day Ring, Goal Ticker, To Do list) — the home page |
| [health.html](health.html) | Supplement / daily stack tracker |
| [po-water.html](po-water.html) | Water intake tracker |
| [finance.html](finance.html) | Finances |
| [gym.html](gym.html) | Progressive overload gym tracker |
| [topbar.js](topbar.js) | Shared top bar — auto-injected into pages that `<script src="topbar.js">` |

Each app stores its own state in browser `localStorage`. No accounts, no server.

## Building from scratch

[BUILD_DASHBOARD.md](BUILD_DASHBOARD.md) is the prompt I gave Claude to generate `index.html` — paste it into Claude if you want to rebuild that page yourself.
